## Logic of Code

In my run_analysis.R script,

I first read Xtest and Xtrain in order to rbind them;

Subsetted the columns representing means and standard deviations. As explained in ##0.4 comment in the script, if this
step is carried out independent of following steps, it would be trivial for the main function to call it.

Added activity IDs and subject IDs to the Xtest and Xtrain files.

Simplified column names.

Merged data with the mergeData function. Till here, Missions 1 and 2 have been performed.

Applied descriptive activity names (which is prescribed in activity_labels.txt).

Make the tidyData.txt

## Variable Descriptions

Here I quote from the original data description.

"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions".
