# CleaningData
============

Course Project Submission for Getting and Cleaning Data Course

Note in Running this Code:

* Please follow the instructions by the course project decription: https://class.coursera.org/getdata-003/human_grading/view/courses/972136/assessments/3/submissions.

* (U may wanna register a coursera account and choose the course first...)

* Make sure that all necessary txt files are in your working directory.

* remember to read the Code book in my repository.

Note in my script

* I assumed that Mission 2 is independent from Missions 3-5.

* I assumed that all used .txt files are consistent with each other for the purpose of this project.

* I assumed in the project description, "means" means the features with "mean()" and "standard deviations" means "std()"
(That does not include things like "meanFreq()")

Notes in References

* I did refer to the course forum and many other materials online. Thanks to all authors of those threads and materials.
