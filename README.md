# CleaningData
============

Course Project Submission for Getting and Cleaning Data Course

## Note in Running this Code:

* Please follow the instructions by the course project decription: https://class.coursera.org/getdata-003/human_grading/view/courses/972136/assessments/3/submissions.

* (U may wanna register a coursera account and choose the course first...)

* Make sure that all necessary txt files are in your working directory.

* Please remember to read the Code book in my repository for details and explanation of the Code.

## Note in my script

* In the Script Comments, by "Mission n" (n = {1,2,3,4,5}) I meant the nth requirement in the project description.

* I assumed that all used .txt files are consistent with each other for the purpose of this project.

* I assumed in the project description, "means" means the features with "mean()" and "standard deviations" means "std()"
(That does not include things like "meanFreq()")

## Notes in References

* In generating the script, the Codebook and the Readme files, I did refer to the course forum and many other literatures online. My heartfelt thanks to all authors of those threads and literatures.
